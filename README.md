The Crios Productivity Tracker gamifies the process of creating new habits.
Users are given an egg that they take care of by regularly (at a rate set by them) performing their task. 
They can log sessions either with a timer or by checking off a tasks completion and as they do so their egg hatches into a creature to care for. If they fail to take care of their creature it may get ill or even pass away!
